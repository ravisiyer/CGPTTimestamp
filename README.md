Launch and One-Touch-Add Timestamp Recorder
=====================================
This is a launch and one-touch-add timestamp recorder app with facility to add a note to any timestamp entry. As it has been developed using React Native and Expo, there is an Android app version and a web version. As I do not have access to a MacOS computer nor an iOS phone/tablet, I did not create an iOS app.

It has the following features:
- Automatically creates a timestamp when the app is launched.
- Add (Timestamp) buttons: Adds timestamp and shows the interval from last timestamp.
- Export button: Exports timestamps data as .csv.
- MS Toggle button: Toggles display of milliseconds in the main list.
- Clear button: Clears timestamps.
- Tap/Click on timestamp: Shows modal to view/edit note (always displays milliseconds).
- Maximum timestamps: 100
