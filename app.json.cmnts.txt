EAS cloud builds (first iOS build which failed as I don't have Apple dev a/c and then Android build) bumped up 
version code in EAS managed stuff to 6 (from 4). So the .AAB file generated by EAS shows in EAS dev website as:
Version:  1.2.1 (6)
The EAS build command on PC also gave this message:
âœ” Incremented versionCode from 5 to 6.
android.versionCode field in app config is ignored when version source is set to remote, but this value will still be in the manifest available via expo-constants. It's recommended to remove this value from app config.
-----

But we will need the value in app.json (app config) for local builds done without using EAS.
So I have updated versionCode to 6 from its current value of 4. Note that eas build does not change app.json's 
versionCode (android.versionCode).
Now the internal version code of app (android.versionCode) as specified by app.json is in sync with eas remote build 
data.
